        <p>Our general approach during this penetration test was as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Reconnaissance</b><br/>We attempted to gather as much information as possible about the
                target. Reconnaissance can take two forms: active and passive. A
                passive attack is always the best starting point as this would normally defeat
                intrusion detection systems and other forms of protection, etc., afforded to the
                network. This would usually involve trying to discover publicly available
                information by utilizing a web browser and visiting newsgroups etc. An active form
                would be more intrusive and may show up in audit logs and may take the form of a
                social engineering type of attack.</li>
            <li><b>Enumeration</b><br/>We used varied operating system fingerprinting tools to determine
                what hosts are alive on the network and more importantly what services and operating
                systems they are running. Research into these services would be carried out to
                tailor the test to the discovered services.</li>
            <li><b>Scanning</b><br/>Through the use of vulnerability scanners, all discovered hosts would be tested
                for vulnerabilities. The result would be analyzed to determine if there any
                vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain access to a target host on a
                network.</li>
            <li><b>Obtaining Access</b><br/>Through the use of published exploits or weaknesses found in
                applications, operating system and services access would then be attempted. This may
                be done surreptitiously or by more brute force methods.</li>
        </ol>

        <title>Risk Classification</title>
        <p>Throughout the document, each vulnerability or risk identified has been labeled and
            categorized as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Extreme</b><br/>Extreme risk of security controls being compromised with the possibility
                of catastrophic financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>High</b><br/>High risk of security controls being compromised with the potential for
                significant financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>Elevated</b><br/>Elevated risk of security controls being compromised with the potential
                for material financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>Moderate</b><br/>Moderate risk of security controls being compromised with the potential
                for limited financial/reputational losses occurring as a result.</li>
            <li><b>Low</b><br/>Low risk of security controls being compromised with measurable negative
                impacts as a result.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that this risk rating system was taken from the Penetration Testing Execution
            Standard (PTES). For more information, see:
