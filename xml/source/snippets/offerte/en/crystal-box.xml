<title>The Crystal-Box Pentesting Method</title>
<p>
  Crystal-box vs. black-box pentesting refers to the amount of information about the target environment, architecture, and/or applications the customer initially shares with the pentesters. With black-box testing, pentesters are given no information whatsoever about the target(s). With crystal-box testing, pentesters are given all information requested about the target(s), including source-code (when relevant), access to developers or system management, etc.

  <company_short/> will conduct crystal-box pentesting, which is the preferred 
  method. Unlike real-world attackers who have all of the time in the world, 
  penetration testing tends to happen within a limited time frame. Crystal-box 
  pentesting allows us to make the most efficient use of the time allotted, thus 
  maximizing the number of vulnerabilities that can be found. Additionally
  crystal-box pentesting fits naturally hand-in-hand with the "Peek Over Our Shoulder" option that <company_short/> offers to <client_short/>.
