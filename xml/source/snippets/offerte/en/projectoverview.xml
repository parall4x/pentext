        <!-- snippet --><p><company_short/> will perform <company_svc_long/> 
        for <client_short/> of the systems described below. The services are intended 
        to gain insight into the security of these systems. To do so, <company_short/> 
        will access these systems, attempt to find vulnerabilities, and gain 
        further access and elevated privileges by exploiting any vulnerabilities 
        found.</p>
        
        <!-- snippet --><p><company_short/> will test the following targets 
        (the “<b>Targets</b>”):</p>
        
        <generate_targets/>
        
        <!-- snippet --><p><company_short/> will test for the presence of the 
        most common vulnerabilities, using both publicly available vulnerability 
        scanning tools and manual testing. <company_short/> shall perform a 
        <p_duration/>-day, <p_boxtype/>, intrusive test via the internet.</p>
        
		<!-- snippet --> <!--Not Needed if Disclaimer is Included; Duplicate Text-->
		<!--p>It is possible that in the course of the penetration 
		testing, <company_short/> might hinder the operations of the Targets or 
		cause damage to the Targets. <client_short/> gives permission for this, to 
		the extent that <company_short/> does not act negligently or 
		recklessly. <client_short/> also warrants it has the authority to give such 
		permission.</p-->
        
		<!-- snippet --><!--Not Needed if Disclaimer is Included; Duplicate Text-->
		<!--p>It is important to understand the limits of 
		<company_short/>'s services. <company_short/> does not (and cannot) 
		give guarantees that something is secure. <company_short/> instead has 
		an obligation to make reasonable efforts (in Dutch: 
		“<i>inspanningsverplichting</i>”) to perform the agreed services.</p-->
