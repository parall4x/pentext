		<p>It is possible that in the course of the penetration testing, <company_short/> 
		might hinder the operations of the Targets or cause damage to the Targets.
		<client_short/> gives permission for this, to the extent that <company_short/> 
		does not act negligent or recklessly. <client_short/> also warrants it has the 
		authority to give such permission.</p>
		
		<p>It is important to understand the limits of <company_short/>'s services. 
		<company_short/> does not (and cannot) give guarantees that something is 
		secure. <company_short/>, instead, has an obligation to make reasonable 
		efforts (in Dutch: “<i>inspanningsverplichting</i>”) to perform the 
		agreed services.</p>
		
		<p><company_short/> and <client_short/> agree to take reasonable measures to 
		maintain the confidentiality of information and personal data they gain 
		access to in the course of performing the penetration test within the 
		Targets. Both parties will use the information and data they receive or 
		access only for the purposes outlined in this agreement. 
		<company_short/> warrants that all core-team members, external freelancers, 
		and volunteers it engages to perform the penetration test have signed a 
		non-disclosure agreement (NDA). </p>
